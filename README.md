# EP-EDL
EP-EDL is an accurate ensemble deep learning predictor using only protein sequence information for human essential protein prediction.

## Requirements
- torch == 1.4.0 
- torchvision == 0.7.0 
- numpy == 1.16.4
- scikit-learn == 0.23.2
- imblearn == 0.7.0

## Usage
In this GitHub project, we give a demo to show how EP-EDL works. 

In the **data** folder, we provide 

1.  **human_protein_sequence_remove_redundancy.xlsx** contains the raw protein sequences and their labels. You can use them for other sequence-based essential protein prediction.
2. **train_test_dset.pkl** are used to store the training and test sets which are generated by random seed of `19980530`. The random seed is used to ensure that you can produce the same results as in the paper.
3. Beside, the processed protein sequence features, i.e., **pssm.pkl**, can be downloaded at  https://pan.baidu.com/s/1kda3AD8EHW7y0Xu2bc4jQA (access code: i166 ).

In our demo, we provide a python file (**main.py**) to train and evaluate the ensemble predictor. You can train the model with a very simple way by using the command below:

```
python main.py
```

In the **saved_models** folder, we provide 17 trained base models. The models are trained using **GPU**.

The other details can see the paper and the codes.
